### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcus Molinero (a.k.a Molinux) from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working with Linux and OpenSource technologies since 2005. Currently I'm a Freelancer Linux and OpenSource Specialist. I'm passionate about open source technologies and to help companies to improve your workflow through opensource solutions or deeloped by me.

In my free time I like to practice some sports (:swimmer: :bike: :running:), photography (:camera:) and coding (:computer:)

Here are some technologies that I have been working and studying currently:

```JSON
{
      "DevOps": ["Docker", "AWS", "Kubernetes", "Ansible", "Zabbix", "Bacula"],
         "Dev": ["JavaScript", "ReactJS", "NodeJS", "React Native"],
 "Audiovisual": ["Photoshop", "Premiere"]
}
```

Would you like to find me?

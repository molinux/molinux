### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcus Molinero (a.k.a Molinux) from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working with Linux and OpenSource technologies since 2005. Currently I'm a Freelancer Linux and OpenSource Specialist. I'm passionate about open source technologies and to help companies to improve your workflow through opensource solutions or developed by me.

In my free time I like to practice some sports (:swimmer: :bike: :running:), to help my friend to improve your life projects (:green_heart:) and coding (:computer:)
